# Simple Logger
This repository showcases how a logger class can be created for complicated python frameworks and platforms.
More and more customizations can be added. This is kept to simple so that everyone can understand and use it.
For each handlers, we can have seperate log levels, log formats. But class created in logger.py is set to use only common level and format. If you want to change it for your own usecase, please feel free to change it and use


- `main.py` contains example code how we can import and use the logger
- `logger.py` contains the logger class creation code
- `logger.yaml` contains the configuration file format
- `app.log` shows how log is printed on console or written to log file
